#The following contains the code necessary to theoretically automate the temperature reading on 3-hour intervals, sending message if it gets out of regulation status.
#Disclaimer: Much of the code are borrowed from Konstantin Dimitrov and Borya, as mentioned in the slides. Original codes are made in the integration of the two projects, as well as repeated temperature-reading and messages.
